# Blackjack-console-game
blackjack console game that uses 1 deck
When the game asks how much do you want to bet, you can activate cheat codes by typing ActivateCheat
Cheat code #1 will let you choose the first two cards but it won't take those cards out of the deck so you could end up with two cards that are the same which can create bugs in the game. Also, if the two cards that you choose were already chosen when it was dealt without the cheat codes, you could end up with no cards being dealt and your total would be 0 because the cards you choose were already taken out of the deck.
The game has 3 levels. Player and dealer start off with the same amount of cash. The objective is to take all of the dealer's cash until dealer has less than $10.
If your cash amount falls less than $10 you will lose the entire game. 
Min bet is $10 and max bet is $40
I made it to where you have the choice to double down only if your first two cards adds up to 10 or 11.
It should be bug free but let me know if you spot any bugs!
